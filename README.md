READ THIS BEFORE DOWNLOADING:

- You will probably have to change your delays
- For 1.7: guiDelay will likely have to be at least 800ms
- Don't reset right after unpausing, it will not work (only way to fix this would be a huge delay for every reset)
- When playing, you can only reset while unpaused
- When on wall, you can only reset while paused or on the title screen
- Make sure you don't have spaces in the file paths to your instances
- You need instanceNumber.txt in your .minecrafts
- Set pauseOnLostFocus to false in your options.txt/standardoptions.txt
- Window titles are different from macros for other versions, so configure your OBS scenes accordingly
- You can use "Window title must match", so you don't have to reload scenes
