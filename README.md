- Make sure you don't have spaces in the file paths to your instances
- You need instanceNumber.txt in your .minecrafts
- Set pauseOnLostFocus to false in your options.txt/standardoptions.txt
- Click on your instances once after starting them (so that they aren't orange in the taskbar, fixes mouse glitching)
- You can use "Window title must match", so you don't have to reload scenes
- Your AHK needs to be V1.1
- OBS language should be set to English
- If you're using Windows 11 or OBS 28+, you're just asking for trouble
